# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to push your project to GitHub:

1. Initialize Git repository (if not already initialized):
```bash
git init
```

2. Configure Git (replace with your details):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

3. Create a new repository on GitHub:
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Enter repository name: "pet-products-erp"
- Add a description: "Enterprise Resource Planning system for Pet Products Distribution"
- Choose public or private repository
- Do not initialize with README (we already have one)
- Click "Create repository"

4. Add all files to Git:
```bash
git add .
```

5. Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Pet Products ERP system"
```

6. Add GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pet-products-erp.git
```

7. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Important Notes

1. Ensure you have GitHub CLI or GitHub credentials configured on your system
2. The .gitignore file is already set up to exclude:
   - node_modules/
   - Build outputs (dist/, build/)
   - Environment files (.env*)
   - IDE files
   - Logs and cache
   - Database files

3. Before pushing, verify you're not including sensitive data:
   - Check that .env files are in .gitignore
   - Ensure no API keys or passwords are in the code
   - Verify database credentials are properly secured

4. After pushing, verify on GitHub that:
   - All necessary files are included
   - No sensitive data was accidentally pushed
   - The repository structure matches your local project

5. Next steps after successful push:
   - Set up branch protection rules if needed
   - Configure GitHub Actions if CI/CD is required
   - Add collaborators if working in a team
   - Update repository settings as needed
