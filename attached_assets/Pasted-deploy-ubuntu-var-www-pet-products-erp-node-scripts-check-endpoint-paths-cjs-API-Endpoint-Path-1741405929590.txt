=== Nginx Configuration Check ===
If you are using Nginx as a reverse proxy, make sure your configuration contains:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;  # Make sure this matches your app's port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

=== Possible Issues ===
1. API routes not configured correctly
2. Server not running or not listening on correct port/address
3. Nginx or other proxy not configured correctly
4. Firewall blocking connections
