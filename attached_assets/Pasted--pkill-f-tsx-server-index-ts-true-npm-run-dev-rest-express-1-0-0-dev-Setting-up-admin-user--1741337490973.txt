I've identified that the issue is caused by duplicate declarations of API functions. The functions are defined at the top of the file and then imported again. We need to remove the duplicate declarations and properly organize the code.

I can see there are duplicate declarations in the RolesPage.tsx file. The issue is that we have API utility functions declared both at the top of the file and also being imported from "@/lib/api". Let me fix this by removing the duplicate declarations and using the imported functions.

I see the 500 error is still occurring when creating a role. Looking at the server logs, I notice that the permissions column in the database is required (NOT NULL) and expects a specific JSONB format. Let me fix the role creation process to ensure the permissions are properly formatted and passed to the database.

Still getting "API error: 500"
I am thinking that the permissions are not handled properly in the system

MA

I'll help you troubleshoot the 500 API error related to permissions. Based on the code inspection, I've identified a few issues in the role permissions implementation that might be causing the problem.

Looking at the RolePermissionsPage.tsx file, there appears to be incomplete code implementation. The file seems to be missing the definition for the Role interface, the modules array, and the mutation for updating permissions.

Let's fix this by implementing the missing parts in the RolePermissionsPage:

client/src/pages/RolePermissionsPage.tsx
Next, let's ensure that the API endpoint for updating permissions properly returns helpful error messages by adding better error handling in the routes.ts file:

server/routes.ts
Let's also add schema validation for the role permissions payload using Zod:

Then, let's use this schema in the permissions endpoint:

Finally, let's add a simple function to check for the server port in the terminal to determine if there might be connectivity issues:

lsof -i :5000
The 500 API error is likely occurring because:

The RolePermissionsPage implementation was incomplete with missing interfaces and permissions handling logic
The error handling in the API endpoint wasn't providing helpful error messages
The permission validation wasn't properly checking the structure of the permission objects
The changes I've made should:

Provide a complete implementation of the RolePermissionsPage
Add better error handling and validation for permissions
Make sure the API returns detailed error messages instead of generic 500 errors
Once these changes are applied, you should be able to see more specific error messages if there are still issues. Remember to check the server console for any error logs as well, which might provide more details about the root cause.

API error: 500

Could you please analyze and tell why we are getting this error.

Is the admin user has sufficient rights to create new record in the Role module?
Why we are getting this "API error: 500", what is the reason?

Based on the error logs and the existing codebase, I can analyze what's causing the "API error: 500":

Yes, the admin user has sufficient rights to create new records in the Role module. The admin role typically has full permissions.

The specific error is: null value in column "permissions" of relation "roles" violates not-null constraint. This means you're trying to create a role without providing the required "permissions" field, which cannot be null according to your database schema.

Looking at the server logs, I can see this error:

Error creating role: error: null value in column "permissions" of relation "roles" violates not-null constraint
